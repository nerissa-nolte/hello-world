github guided tutorial

Hello! Nerisssa here. After getting my feet wet with bash shell scripting, 
I am ready to learn python. As you can see, I will also be learning how to use Git Hub.
Other languages I am exploring inlcude Javascript and C.  
Previous languages explored include C++ and Swift.  

I am planning to complete some small projects, and refine old assignments, while also learning Git through the command line.
