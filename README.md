github guided tutorial

Hello! Nerisssa here. After getting my feet wet with bash shell scripting, 
I am ready to learn python. As you can see, I will also be learning how to use Git Hub.
Other languages I am exploring inlcude Javascript and C.  
Previous languages explored include C++ and Swift.  

I am planning to complete some small projects, and refine old assignments, while also learning Git through the command line.  

If you have 'Keep my email address private' && 'Block command line pushes that expose my email'  
in your Git Account -> Email Settings, you will need to adjust your global email settings to reflect the 
000000000+username@users.noreply.github.com address.
> git config --global user.email "email@example.com"
